# Organisation Setup

These instructions are the initial setup for an organisation that's going to use `gha-scala-library-release-workflow`.
When we say "organisation", we mean a GitHub organisation (like [github.com/guardian](https://github.com/guardian)), but
these instructions more or less also apply to a single GitHub user account, if you want to set up your own personal
repos to use this workflow.

## 1. Set up the GitHub App

See [Setting up the GitHub App](github-app.md) for details on how to create the necessary GitHub App.

## 2. Create credentials

See [Generating new credentials](credentials/generating-credentials.md) for details on how to create the necessary
credentials, and [Supplying credentials](credentials/supplying-credentials.md) for how to store and supply them to
your repos.

## 3. Configure repos to use the release workflow

See [Configuration](configuration.md) for details on how to configure your repos to use the release workflow.
